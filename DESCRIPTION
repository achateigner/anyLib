Description: Made to make your life simpler with packages, by
    installing and loading a list of packages, whether they are on CRAN,
    Bioconductor or github. For github, if you do not have the full path, with 
    the maintainer name in it (e.g. "achateigner/topReviGO"), it will be able to
    load it but not to install it.
